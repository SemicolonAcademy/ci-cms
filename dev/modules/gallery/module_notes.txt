/*************************************************
 * Gallery MOdule Notes

 *************************************************

 The gallery module uses the jquery live() method
 and therefore requires jquery 1.3 or later. The
 live() method is needed for proper operation of
 the ajax calls. Without the live method the ajax
 binding is lost after the first subpage load. 
 
 This can be solved two ways. The first is to use
 the $().live() method and the second is to rebind 
 the the ajax load() method. The first method was 
 used as it was more stright forward and required 
 less code and less headaches to get up and working.
