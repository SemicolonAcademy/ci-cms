When you install it under a sub-folder and you want to use .htaccess, verify that you specified the _RewriteBase_


  * Make writable the folders *./media* and *./cache* 
  * Rename database.dist.php in ./application/config to database.php and fill it with your database configuration.
  * Rename config.dist.php in ./application/config to config.php and adjust it to your needs.
  * Go to yoursite/install and follow the installation steps
  * The first username and password will become the main administrator. You can add more later.
