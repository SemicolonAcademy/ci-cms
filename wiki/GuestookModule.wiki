#Creating Guestbook module

= Introduction =

With this example, we will create a Guestbook module to help you understand how to create your own module.


= File structure =

We will create a directory called *guestbook* and put it inside *modules*. At the end, we will get files like this but let us take it one by one:

{{{

          |__ guestbook
                 |__ controllers
                 |       |__ admin.php (backend page: optional)
                 |       |__ index.php (front-end page of the module)
                 |
                 |__ models
                 |       |__ guestbook_model.php (your model file)
                 |                         
                 |__ views
                 |       |__ admin.php (backend view) 
                 |       |__ index.php (backend view)
                 |
                 |__ guestbook_install.php
                 |__ guestbook_uninstall.php
                 |__ guestbook_plugins.php
                 |__ guestbook_blocks.php
                 |__ setup.xml
}}}
